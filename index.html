              <h4>What your BMI result means</h4>
              <p>
                A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
                Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of
                experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2
                diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar
                content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables.
                Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally
                about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.
